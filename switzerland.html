        <h3>
            When it comes to travel destinations, it doesn’t get much better than Switzerland. Teeming with incredible alpine vistas, exciting outdoor adventures, and incredible food (chocolate and cheese galore!), you’re sure to have a vacation to remember. You can add it to your European itinerary or spend your holiday just exploring the country, and you won’t run out of things to do or see. But before you pack your ski gear, here are fascinating and handy facts about Switzerland to know before your trip:
1. There are four official languages

Switzerland is divided into four different language regions: French in the western part, Italian in the southern part, Romansh in some areas of the southeast, and Swiss-German in the rest. But don’t worry, you can get by speaking English in major cities like Zurich, Geneva, and other tourist destinations. Of course, learning some new phrases won’t hurt.
2. The Alps make up almost 60% of the country

One of the most incredible facts about Switzerland is that the Swiss Alps cover around 58% of the land area. Despite the abundance of mountains, the country’s landscape is actually pretty diverse. In the northern part of the Alps, like the Bernese Oberland, you’ll find that the scenery is very green and vibrant. While in the south like Valais, it’s drier and rougher. You’ll also see stunning lakes and villages full of palm trees in between.
3. No Euros here

If you’re going to be coming from a different European country, you might be surprised to see price tags and menus showing a different currency. Switzerland uses Swiss francs (CHF) as opposed to euros. But don’t fret, the euro is widely accepted in Switzerland. Although, you might only be able to use euro banknotes (no coins) and you’ll get your change in Swiss Francs.
4. Travel adaptors are a must

If you’re going to charge your phone, you’ll notice that their socket has three round holes as opposed to only two, like in most of Europe. The good news is that you can still use your European travel adapter in Switzerland. Just make sure that the prongs fit because sometimes European plugs are too big for Swiss sockets. The voltage is also similar to the rest of the continent which is 230 V/50 Hz.
5. No tips necessary

7. Great transportation options

You can get around by train, funiculars, buses, boats, cable cars, and trams. It’s so comprehensive that you can reach areas in the Alps that were only previously accessible by foot.

9. The climate is more mild than cold

Because of the popularity of the ski resorts and the Alps, Switzerland has gained a reputation for being a cold country. But the climate is actually considered more moderate rather than cold because of the nearby Atlantic Ocean. If you’re hoping for snow days, it’s best to visit in January, February, and March. 
10. No cars allowed (in some villages)
